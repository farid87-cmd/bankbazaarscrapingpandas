                                BAJAJ FINANCE has offered a pre approved personal loan offer and I accepted for the same. I have taken this loan 2 months back. The process was smooth and submitted required docuemtns within 1.5 hrs amount was credited to my account with 1.64L with tenure period of 4 years. The rate of interest is 18% which is high. Fee was deducted of 9K. There is pre closure option after 30 days with charge of 4%. EMI need to pay the amount of 4K. The best which I would like to say is online process was done with short term.

                                The tenure for ICICI  personal loan is for 3 years, I have taken the loan for some personal purposes. I got my loan statements on time but the interest rate of the loan is 12% which is bit high for me. I wish the bank can reduce it up to 10%. Otherwise everything is good about the loan.",B  LATHASREE,ICICI Bank
